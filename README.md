# CSS-and-Bootstrap-Responsive-Portfolio

For Homework 2, we were required to create an online portfolio from scratch utilizing CSS nad bootstrap. 

The website would consist of  "About Me", "Portfolio" and "Contact" pages.

Code from Bootstrap would provide the framework for us to build the layout and necessary functionality. 

The navigation bar at the top of the page must be functional and direct each user to each page of the website. 

The HTML code includes descriptions of each section of the page.

We were required to make multiple commits during the build process, so that we would have multiple versions available should be need to debug and/or revert to previous versions.
